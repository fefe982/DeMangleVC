# DeMangleVC
Toy project to demangle the symbol names generated by VC.

This is a project I started years ago, as toy to know something about both C# and C++.
It main purpose is to get the undecorated names from the mangled symbol names generated by VC.

I started the project before I even know about `UndecorateSymbolName` in `dbghelp.dll`.
But after I know it, I believes this project can do better than `UndecoratedSymbolName`.
You can refer to the `REFINE__` macro in the code.
Without it, the project tries to generate exact the same output as `UndecorateSymbolName`;
with `REFINE__`, the project will do some of its own refinement.

One example would be, in `UndecorateSymbolName`, there is no blank between `operater??` and
the following template parameter list. So you can see things like `operator<<int>(...)` in the output.
The project with refine will insert a blank: `operator< <int>(...)`.

Also, there are a lot of symbols that `UndecorateSymbolName` cannot handle.
The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms679294%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">latest `dbghelp`</a> is from 2010, so you know why.

The project now wors with VS2013. You can get a community version for free.

## Introduction to the sub-projects
### DeMangleVC
Main project. Written in C# Accepts file with decorated symbols, and output the undecorated ones.

The input file contains one symbol per line. Only the symbol before the first blank will be handled,
anything else would be deleted. So you can put whatever you like after the symbol, like comments.

### UnDecorateSymbolName
Simple project that uses `UndecorateSymolName` to do the job. You must obtain your own version of `dbghelp`.

### GetAsmName
Get decorated symbol names from VS generated ASM files.
It will aslo retrieve the 'partial' undecorated version in the comments if they exist,
and put it in the output for reference.

### GenNames
This is a project I used to generated various symbols.

This project is not expected to pass link or do anything useful.
It will just output an ASM for the input cpp files, possibly with bunch of symbols.
You can try to see how symbols are decorated.
